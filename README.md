# RChemMass
Various Cheminformatic, Curation and Mass Spectrometry Functions

RChemMass combines many useful functions for manipulating 
structures, retrieving identifiers, calculating values etc. with a
focus on functions relevant for non-target small molecule mass 
spectrometry (hence RChemMass = R+Cheminformatics+MassSpec).
This builds on many functions authored by others - thank you 
to those who have contributed indirectly through their work 
and discussions! Function specific contributors are mentioned 
in the function documentation.

RChemMass includes work done at the Swiss Federal Institute
of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) and the 
Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, University
of Luxembourg.
